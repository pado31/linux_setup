### Waring
Use it carefully - I am not responsible for your ricing ;)


### Guide
Run the script 
```
$ sh setup.sh
```

It will:
1. Update the system;
2. Install the packages;
3. Create working directories;
4. Configure the system and activate the services.

Notes about some packages:
- **sway** window manager;
- **waybar** status bar
- **alsa** audio management (try `alsamixer`);
- **qrcp** file exchanger between terminal and smartphone through a QR code;
- **tlp** power management;
- **grim** for screenshots.
